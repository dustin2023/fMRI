### A. Introduction to the topic and motivation

Thoughts, emotions, intelligence, and even consciousness - all these phenomena take place/ occur in our brain. Despite comprising only about 2% of our body weight, the brain consumes more than 20% of the total energy and oxygen intake. It is an astonishing marvel and the most powerful computer on our planet.

But how does this fascinating/remarkable organ actually work?

For a long time, scientists had no way of looking into/ observing an active brain. Imagine the enormous benefits/ advantages we would have if we could. Not only could we develop significantly more powerful computers or devise / create new treatment methods for mental illnesses, but we could also answer fundamental questions: Who are we? What defines us as human beings?

It was only in 1992 that scientists invented a method that allowed them to examine/ investigate the brain in its active state.This groundbreaking method revolutionized our understanding of the brain and opened up entirely new perspectives for studying neural activities

This study will focus on an imaging technique that enables precisely that - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). With the help of fMRI, it is possible to explore the functionality of each brain region and gain insights into neuronal activities.

We will examine the fundamentals of this technology, including the functioning of fMRI imaging and its underlying physical principles. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the technical aspects of fMRI devices and provide a detailed explanation of data analysis in fMRI. Finally, we will explore its practical applications and offer / provide a brief outlook on the significance of fMRI in the future.

The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the imaging technique fMRI and demonstrate/ to highlight its significance in various fields.

Through the use of / Using fMRI technology, we are able to gain valuable insights into the functioning of the brain and obtain / achieve a deeper understanding of our own human nature. By visualizing neural activities in the brain, fMRI enables us to explore the fundamentals of thoughts, emotions, intelligence, and consciousness. Therefore, fMRI technology serves as a powerful tool that aids us in deciphering the intricate mechanisms of the brain and attaining a deeper comprehension of its workings.
